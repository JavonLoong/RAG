## Limitations

- This run uses retrieved context as the answer, so it measures parsing, chunking, indexing, and retrieval first.
- It is not yet a full LLM generation quality score.
- Microsoft GraphRAG open-question datasets are not included in the numeric score because they do not ship ordinary gold answers.
